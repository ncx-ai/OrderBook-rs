## High-Performance Lock-Free Order Book Engine

A high-performance, thread-safe limit order book implementation written in Rust. This project provides a comprehensive order matching engine designed for low-latency trading systems, with a focus on concurrent access patterns and lock-free data structures.

### Key Features

- **Lock-Free Architecture**: Built using atomics and lock-free data structures to minimize contention and maximize throughput in high-frequency trading scenarios.

- **Multiple Order Types**: Support for various order types including standard limit orders, iceberg orders, post-only, fill-or-kill, immediate-or-cancel, good-till-date, trailing stop, pegged, market-to-limit, and reserve orders with custom replenishment logic.

- **Thread-Safe Price Levels**: Each price level can be independently and concurrently modified by multiple threads without blocking.

- **Advanced Order Matching**: Efficient matching algorithm for both market and limit orders, correctly handling complex order types and partial fills.

- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in statistics tracking for benchmarking and monitoring system performance.

- **Memory Efficient**: Designed to scale to millions of orders with minimal memory overhead.

### Design Goals

This order book engine is built with the following design principles:

1. **Correctness**: Ensure that all operations maintain the integrity of the order book, even under high concurrency.
2. **Performance**: Optimize for low latency and high throughput in both write-heavy and read-heavy workloads.
3. **Scalability**: Support for millions of orders and thousands of price levels without degradation.
4. **Flexibility**: Easily extendable to support additional order types and matching algorithms.

### Use Cases

- **Trading Systems**: Core component for building trading systems and exchanges
- **Market Simulation**: Tool for back-testing trading strategies with realistic market dynamics
- **Research**: Platform for studying market microstructure and order flow
- **Educational**: Reference implementation for understanding modern exchange architecture

### What's New in Version 0.8.0

#### v0.8.0 — Quote-notional market orders (#85)

- **New public API** on [`OrderBook<T>`]:
  [`match_market_order_by_amount`](OrderBook::match_market_order_by_amount)
  and the STP-aware
  [`match_market_order_by_amount_with_user`](OrderBook::match_market_order_by_amount_with_user),
  plus the convenience
  [`submit_market_order_by_amount`](OrderBook::submit_market_order_by_amount)
  and
  [`submit_market_order_by_amount_with_user`](OrderBook::submit_market_order_by_amount_with_user)
  wrappers that run the kill-switch and pre-trade risk gates.
- **Binance `quoteOrderQty` semantics.** Callers say "buy ~$1,000 of BTC"
  without converting to base quantity. The matching loop walks the
  opposite side until the requested quote-notional `amount` is
  consumed, the book is exhausted, or — when `lot_size` is configured
  on the book — the residual notional cannot fund another whole lot.
  Fees are **exclusive**: caller pays `amount + taker_fee`.
- **Lot enforcement preserved.** Per-level base quantity is rounded
  down to a multiple of `lot_size`, so notional walks never emit
  `qty=0` trades when the budget falls below one full lot at the
  current level price. `lot_size = None` is equivalent to `lot = 1`.
- **New error variant
  [`OrderBookError::InsufficientLiquidityNotional`]** — distinct from
  `InsufficientLiquidity` so callers can pattern-match on
  quote-vs-base semantics.
- **`TradeResult.quote_notional: u128`** — populated for *both* the
  base-quantity and quote-notional market-order paths so consumers
  read `Σ price × quantity` directly without recomputing per-trade.
  `#[serde(default)]` keeps existing JSON / Bincode payloads
  parseable.
- **Additive `SequencerCommand::MarketOrderByAmount { id, amount, side }`**
  variant. Old journals replay byte-identical; new journals carrying
  this variant fail on older binaries — consistent with the precedent
  for prior `SequencerCommand` rollouts. No
  `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump required.
- **`StopCondition` refactor of the matching loop** — single inner
  implementation drives both base-qty and notional walks. Base-qty
  path stays allocation- and branch-light: the new helpers fold to
  the same arithmetic the previous loop emitted when `lot <= 1`.
- Runnable example: `cargo run -p examples --bin market_order_by_amount`.
- HDR bench: `notional_walk_hdr` mirrors `aggressive_walk_hdr` with
  the notional path so p50/p99/p99.9/p99.99 can be compared.

### What's New in Version 0.7.0

#### v0.7.0 — Feature-gated allocation counter

- **New feature `alloc-counters`** (default off). Exposes
  \[`CountingAllocator`\] and \[`AllocSnapshot`\] at the crate root.
  Wraps any inner [`GlobalAlloc`](std::alloc::GlobalAlloc) and
  tracks four `AtomicU64` counters: `allocs`, `deallocs`,
  `bytes_allocated`, `bytes_deallocated`.
- Bench / test binaries opt in via
  `#[global_allocator] static A: CountingAllocator<System> = ...`.
  The library `rlib` does **not** install a global allocator.
- **`bench_count`** bench + **`alloc_budget_tests`** integration
  test run the mixed 70/20/10 workload; the bench reports
  `allocs_per_op`, the test asserts a conservative ceiling for
  regression detection.
- **`BENCH.md`** gains an "Allocation profile" section.

#### v0.7.0 — Metrics and Observability (#60)

- **New optional `metrics` feature** wires Prometheus-style
  counters and gauges into the matching engine. Default `off`;
  when enabled, every increment goes through the global
  [`metrics`](https://docs.rs/metrics) facade so any compatible
  recorder (Prometheus exporter, OpenTelemetry bridge, etc.)
  can collect them.
- **Surface (stable across `0.7.x`):**
  - `orderbook_rejects_total{reason="..."}` — counter, one
    increment per rejected order. Label value is the
    [`RejectReason`] [`Display`](std::fmt::Display) string.
  - `orderbook_depth_levels_bid` /
    `orderbook_depth_levels_ask` — gauges, current count of
    distinct price levels on each side. Updated on every
    structural mutation (add, cancel, modify, fill).
  - `orderbook_trades_total` — counter, monotonic count of
    every emitted trade transaction (one increment per
    `MatchResult` transaction).
- **Determinism preserved.** Metrics emission is out-of-band:
  no allocation on the happy path, no influence on matching
  outcomes, and `restore_from_snapshot_package` deliberately
  does **not** rehydrate counters — they are operational only
  and live for the process lifetime. The integration test
  `tests/metrics/` proves byte-identical snapshots between two
  books with metrics enabled.
- **Compile-time no-op.** When the feature is off every helper
  in [`orderbook::metrics`] compiles to an empty function so
  call-sites in the matching hot path stay unconditional.
- Example: `examples/src/bin/prometheus_export.rs` (run with
  `cargo run --features metrics --bin prometheus_export`)
  demonstrates installing the `metrics-exporter-prometheus`
  recorder and dumping the exposition payload.

#### v0.7.0 — Feature-gated binary wire protocol

- **New `wire` feature flag** behind which a small,
  length-prefixed binary protocol lives — every frame is
  `[len:u32 LE | kind:u8 | payload]`, `len` covers
  `kind + payload`, and all multi-byte integers are
  little-endian. Disabled by default; the existing JSON and
  bincode paths are unchanged. The protocol is additive.
- **`MessageKind`** — `#[repr(u8)]` enum with stable explicit
  discriminants. Inbound: `NewOrder = 0x01`,
  `CancelOrder = 0x02`, `CancelReplace = 0x03`,
  `MassCancel = 0x04`. Outbound: `ExecReport = 0x81`,
  `TradePrint = 0x82`, `BookUpdate = 0x83`.
- **Zero-copy inbound** — `NewOrderWire`, `CancelOrderWire`,
  `CancelReplaceWire`, `MassCancelWire` are
  `#[repr(C, packed)]` with `zerocopy::{FromBytes, IntoBytes,
  Unaligned, Immutable, KnownLayout}` derives. Each ships a
  `const _: () = assert!(size_of::<…>() == N)` guard. Decoding
  is safe — `zerocopy` performs the layout validation, no
  `unsafe` is required at any wire call site.
- **Byte-cursor outbound** — `ExecReport`, `TradePrintWire`,
  `BookUpdateWire` are encoded via explicit
  `extend_from_slice` calls. Outbound is I/O-dominated; this
  keeps the layout free to evolve.
- **`TryFrom<&NewOrderWire> for OrderType<()>`** — boundary
  mapping that copies each packed field into a stack local
  first (taking a reference to a packed field is UB), validates
  the side / TIF / order_type discriminants, and rejects
  negative prices via `WireError::InvalidPayload`.
- **`doc/wire-protocol.md`** with per-message layout tables,
  discriminant table, framing rule, and endianness statement.
- **Round-trip `proptest` coverage** in every
  `src/wire/{inbound,outbound}/*.rs` module.
- Example: `examples/src/bin/wire_roundtrip.rs`
  (`required-features = ["wire"]`).

#### v0.7.0 — HDR-histogram tail-latency bench suite

- **Six new `*_hdr` bench binaries** under
  `benches/order_book/`: `add_only`, `cancel_only`,
  `aggressive_walk`, `mixed_70_20_10`, `thin_book_sweep`,
  `mass_cancel_burst`. Each records per-sample nanosecond
  latencies into an `hdrhistogram::Histogram` and emits
  `p50` / `p99` / `p99.9` / `p99.99` + `min` / `max`. Coexists
  with the existing Criterion benches.
- **`make bench-hdr`** convenience target.
- **Headline numbers + methodology** in `BENCH.md` at the repo
  root, with a closed-loop disclosure block (the suite measures
  service time, not load-induced tail).

#### v0.7.0 — Closed `RejectReason` enum

- **New [`RejectReason`]** — closed
  `#[non_exhaustive] #[repr(u16)]` enum with stable explicit
  discriminants (1..13 + `Other(u16)`). The canonical wire-side
  reject taxonomy; consumers can route on the numeric code without
  parsing strings.
- **`OrderStatus::Rejected.reason: String`** is now
  `RejectReason` — typed, machine-routable, and stable across
  `0.7.x`. Breaking change on a public variant shape; allowed under
  the `0.6.x → 0.7.x` minor delta in `0.x` semver.
- **`impl From<&OrderBookError> for RejectReason`** — operational
  ergonomics. Exhaustive match — a future `OrderBookError` variant
  addition is caught at compile time.
- **Tracker emission on every reject path that already transitioned
  the tracker.** Kill switch, risk gates, and the three internal
  sites in `modifications.rs` (validation / post-only / missing
  user id) now record typed reasons. STP cancel-taker and IOC/FOK
  `InsufficientLiquidity` paths still return typed errors without
  transitioning the tracker — deferred to a follow-up.

#### v0.7.0 — Pre-trade risk layer

- **New [`RiskConfig`]** with three opt-in guard-rails:
  `max_open_orders_per_account`, `max_notional_per_account`, and
  `price_band_bps` against a configurable
  [`ReferencePriceSource`] (`LastTrade` / `Mid` / `FixedPrice`).
  Builder pattern — `RiskConfig::new().with_*(...)` chained.
- **Three new typed reject variants** on the existing
  `#[non_exhaustive]` `OrderBookError`:
  `RiskMaxOpenOrders`, `RiskMaxNotional`, `RiskPriceBand`. Each
  carries enough context (account, current, limit, deviation) for
  downstream consumers to act without parsing a string.
- **`OrderBook::set_risk_config(...)` / `risk_config()` /
  `disable_risk()`** — operator-driven gating. Check ordering on
  submit/add: `kill_switch → risk → STP → fees → match`. Market
  orders bypass the risk layer (no submitted price, no rest);
  kill switch still gates them.
- **Allocation-free** on the happy path. Per-account counters are
  `(AtomicU64, AtomicCell<u128>)` pairs; per-order risk state is a
  `DashMap<Id, RiskEntry>`.
- **`OrderBookSnapshotPackage.risk_config: Option<RiskConfig>`** —
  config persists across snapshot/restore. On restore, per-account
  counters and the per-order map are rebuilt by walking the
  snapshot's resting orders. Snapshot format version stays at `2`;
  the field is additive via `#[serde(default)]`.
- Example: `examples/src/bin/risk_limits.rs`.

#### v0.7.0 — Operational kill switch

- **New `OrderBook::engage_kill_switch()`,
  `OrderBook::release_kill_switch()`, and
  `OrderBook::is_kill_switch_engaged()`** — atomic operational halt
  for new flow. While engaged, every `submit_market_order*`,
  `add_order`, and non-`Cancel` `update_order` call returns the new
  [`OrderBookError::KillSwitchActive`] variant before any matching,
  fee, or STP work happens. Cancel and mass-cancel paths are
  explicitly **not** gated so operators can drain the resting book.
  The flag persists across snapshot/restore.
- **`OrderBookError::KillSwitchActive`** — new typed reject variant
  on the existing `#[non_exhaustive]` enum.
- **`OrderBookSnapshotPackage.kill_switch_engaged: bool`** —
  operational state persists across snapshot/restore. Snapshot
  format version stays at `2`; the field is additive via
  `#[serde(default)]`.
- When an `OrderStateTracker` is configured, kill-switched
  rejections are recorded as
  `OrderStatus::Rejected { reason: RejectReason::KillSwitchActive }`.
- Example: `examples/src/bin/kill_switch_drain.rs`.

#### v0.7.0 — Global `engine_seq` across outbound streams

- **New `OrderBook::next_engine_seq()` and `OrderBook::engine_seq()`**
  accessors backed by an `AtomicU64` counter. Every outbound emission
  (trade event, price-level change event) mints exactly one seq, in
  emission order, so external consumers can perform cross-stream gap
  detection and merge events from `TradeListener` and
  `PriceLevelChangedListener` into a single ordered view.
- **`engine_seq: u64` field** added to every outbound event type:
  `TradeResult`, `TradeEvent`, `PriceLevelChangedEvent`, and the NATS
  `BookChangeEntry`. JSON payloads are forward-compatible
  (`#[serde(default)]` falls back to `0` for v0.6.x payloads).
- **Snapshot format version bumped to `2`**.
  `OrderBookSnapshotPackage` carries `engine_seq` so that
  `restore_from_snapshot_package` resumes monotonicity exactly from the
  snapshotted point. `version: 1` packages are rejected by `validate()`.
- **`BookChangeBatch.sequence`** retains its existing per-batch
  publisher-counter semantics; cross-stream gap detection moves to the
  per-event `BookChangeEntry.engine_seq`. Both fields ship in the same
  payload for incremental adoption.

#### v0.7.0 — `Clock` trait for deterministic replay

- **New [`Clock`] trait** with two implementations, [`MonotonicClock`]
  (production, wraps `SystemTime::now`) and [`StubClock`] (replay /
  tests, monotonic `AtomicU64` counter with configurable start and
  step). Re-exported at the crate root and via [`prelude`].
- **[`OrderBook::with_clock`]** constructor plus `set_clock` and
  `clock()` accessors. The default [`OrderBook::new`] keeps wrapping
  [`MonotonicClock`] internally — existing callers observe no
  behavioural change.
- **`ReplayEngine::replay_from_with_clock`** for byte-identical
  replay tests and disaster-recovery pipelines that must reproduce
  engine timestamps deterministically.
- Wall-clock reads are no longer present inside the matching core —
  every stamp flows through `self.clock().now_millis()`.
- **Behavioural change (same type signature)**:
  `OrderStateTracker::get_history` and `OrderBook::get_order_history`
  now return `Vec<(u64 /* milliseconds */, OrderStatus)>` instead of
  nanoseconds; the `Clock::now_millis` unit is the only one the trait
  exposes.

#### v0.6.2 — Dependency Bumps & Bincode 2.x Migration

- **Dependency refresh**: `uuid` 1.23, `tokio` 1.52, `sha2` 0.11,
  `async-nats` 0.47, `bincode` 2.0 (crates.io `bincode 3.0.0` is a
  `compile_error!` stub, so `2.0` is the current usable major).
- **Bincode API migration** (feature `bincode`): the
  `BincodeEventSerializer` now uses `bincode::serde::encode_to_vec`
  / `decode_from_slice` with `bincode::config::standard()`. The
  public trait and type surface are unchanged.
- **Wire-format note**: bincode 1.x and 2.x produce different byte
  layouts on the NATS transport path. The on-disk journal uses
  `serde_json` and is unaffected (`ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION`
  stays at `1`).

#### v0.6.1 — NATS Integration, Sequencer & Order State

- **NATS JetStream Publishers**: Trade event and book change publishers with retry, batching, and throttling (`nats` feature)
- **Zero-Copy Serialization**: Pluggable `EventSerializer` trait with JSON and Bincode implementations (`bincode` feature)
- **Sequencer Subsystem**: `SequencerCommand`, `SequencerEvent`, `SequencerResult` types for LMAX Disruptor-style total ordering
- **Append-Only Journal**: `FileJournal` with memory-mapped segments, CRC32 checksums, and segment rotation (`journal` feature)
- **In-Memory Journal**: `InMemoryJournal` for testing and benchmarking
- **Deterministic Replay**: `ReplayEngine` for disaster recovery and state verification from journal
- **Order State Machine**: `OrderStatus`, `CancelReason`, `OrderStateTracker` for explicit lifecycle tracking (Open → PartiallyFilled → Filled / Cancelled / Rejected)
- **Order Lifecycle Query API**: `get_order_history()`, `active_order_count()`, `terminal_order_count()`, `purge_terminal_states()`
- **Upgrade to pricelevel v0.7**: `Id`, `Price`, `Quantity`, `TimestampMs` newtypes for stronger type safety

#### v0.5.x — Validation, STP, Fees & Mass Cancel

- **Order Validation**: Tick size, lot size, and min/max order size validation with configurable limits
- **Self-Trade Prevention (STP)**: `CancelTaker`, `CancelMaker`, `CancelBoth` modes with per-order `user_id` enforcement
- **Fee Model**: Configurable `FeeSchedule` with maker/taker fees, fee fields in `TradeResult`
- **Mass Cancel Operations**: Cancel all, by side, by user, by price range — with `MassCancelResult` tracking
- **Cross-Book Mass Cancel**: `cancel_all_across_books()`, `cancel_by_user_across_books()`, `cancel_by_side_across_books()` on `BookManager`
- **Snapshot Config Preservation**: `restore_from_snapshot_package()` preserves fee schedule, STP mode, tick/lot size, and order size limits

#### v0.4.8 — Performance & Architecture

- **Performance Boost**: `PriceLevelCache` for faster best bid/ask lookups, `MatchingPool` to reduce matching engine allocations
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Refactored modification and matching logic for better separation of concerns
- **Enhanced Concurrency**: Improved thread-safe operations under heavy load

### Status
This project is in active development. The core matching engine, order validation, STP, fees, mass cancel, NATS integration, sequencer journal, and order state tracking are production-ready. The Sequencer runtime (async event loop) is under development.

| 100%                     | 19,403,341.34       |

#### Performance Improvements and Deadlock Resolution

The significant performance gains, especially in the "Hot Spot Contention Test," and the resolution of the previous deadlocks are a direct result of refactoring the internal concurrency model of the `PriceLevel`.

- **Previous Bottleneck:** The original implementation relied on a `crossbeam::queue::SegQueue` for storing orders. While the queue itself is lock-free, operations like finding or removing a specific order required draining the entire queue into a temporary list, performing the action, and then pushing all elements back. This process was inefficient and created a major point of contention, leading to deadlocks under heavy multi-threaded load.

- **New Implementation:** The `OrderQueue` was re-designed to use a combination of:
  1. A `dashmap::DashMap` for storing orders, allowing for highly concurrent, O(1) average-case time complexity for insertions, lookups, and removals by `Id`.
  2. A `crossbeam::queue::SegQueue` that now only stores `Id`s to maintain the crucial First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order for matching.

This hybrid approach eliminates the previous bottleneck, allowing threads to operate on the order collection with minimal contention, which is reflected in the massive throughput increase in the hot spot tests.

### 3. Analysis and Conclusions

#### Overall Performance
The system demonstrates excellent capability to handle over **200,000 operations per second** in the high-frequency trading simulation, distributed across order creations, matches, and cancellations.

#### Price Level Distribution Behavior
- **Optimal Performance Range:** The system performs best with 50-100 price levels, achieving 66,000-67,000 operations per second.
- **Performance Degradation:** Performance decreases significantly with fewer price levels, dropping to around 23,000-29,000 operations per second with 1-10 levels.
- **Scalability:** The lock-free architecture demonstrates excellent scalability characteristics across different price level distributions.

#### Hot Spot Contention
- Surprisingly, performance **increases** as more operations concentrate on a hot spot, reaching its maximum with 100% concentration (19,403,341 ops/s).
- This counter-intuitive behavior might indicate:
  1. Very efficient cache effects when operations are concentrated in one memory area
  2. Internal optimizations to handle high-contention cases
  3. Benefits of the system's lock-free architecture

#### OrderBook State Behavior
- During the HFT simulation, the order book handled a significant increase in order volume (from 1,020 to 34,850).
- The spread increased from 100 to 170, reflecting realistic market behavior under pressure.
- The final state shows substantial liquidity with over 274,000 bid quantity and 360,000 ask quantity.

### 4. Practical Implications

- The system is suitable for high-frequency trading environments with the capacity to process over 200,000 operations per second.
- The lock-free architecture proves to be extremely effective at handling contention, especially at hot spots.
- Optimal performance is achieved with moderate price level distribution (50-100 levels).
- For real-world use cases, the system demonstrates excellent scalability and maintains performance under concurrent load.

This analysis confirms that the system design is highly scalable and appropriate for demanding financial applications requiring high-speed processing with data consistency.
